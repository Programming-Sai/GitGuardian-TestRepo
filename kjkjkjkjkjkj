When the Task Scheduler triggers your script, it may run under a different working directory (often C:\Windows\System32), so any relative paths inside your PowerShell scripts (like to your config file) can fail silently.

Here are a few steps to fix this:

1. Use Full Paths in main-runner.ps1
Make sure you reference the config file (and any other file) using its full path. For example, instead of
